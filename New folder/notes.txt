  keywords
  ---------
  -already defined words in python.
  -we can not modify the keywords.
  -every keyword has special meaning.
  -in python there is 33 keywords.
  -all keywords are lower case except False,None,True

  how to list keywords
  help('keywords')

  comments
  --------
  -used to understand the code better and it is for readability
  -comments are not executed by python it just ignores
  -it is used only for reading purpose

  two types of comments
  1)single line comments 
         # symbol is used to provide the comment
       a)always comment on the right of the program
       b)if comment at first the entire line commented

  2)multi line comments
         ''' 
            statements
         '''
   if you need to comment mulitiple lines in the 1000 lines of code
   then we need to use multiline comments.

print('welcome')
'''
a = 20  #20 is assigned to a
b = 40  # 40 is assigned to b
c = a+b  # adding a and b and storing c
print(c)  # display value of c on the console

'''
print('end of the welcome')

indentation
-----------
1)Rule1 :- always starts with first column for all the lines.

2)Rule2:- 
     if any statement ends with colon(:)
     subsequent statement should start with 4 spaces.
          if 10>5:
             print('condition is true')
             print('super execution')
             print('end of the block)
          else:
