1.recursive implementation of Fibonacci series.
Ans:-
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
       return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

2. What are decorators? Write a decorator that logs the function arguments.
Ans:- Decorator is any function that takes in another function and adds functionality to it without manipulating the function itself. It does this by using a wrapper function.

def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args):
        print(“Logging the parameter of “, func, “ is “, args)
        return func
    return wrapper
@decorator
def operation(x, y):
    return x+y
operation(5,20)
@decorator is just a syntactic sugar, it is equivalent to
res = decorator(operation(5,20))

3. question follows below 
   arr1 = list(range(10)); 
   arr2 = arr1; 
   arr3 = arr1[:]

   Is arr2 == arr3 ?

Ans:-
No, arr2 = arr1 creates a new reference of arr1 and assigns it to arr2. whereas, arr3 = arr1[:] copies the content of arr1 and assigns it to new variable called arr3.

arr1 = [1,2,3,4]
arr2 = arr1
arr3 = arr1[:]
arr1.append(5)
print(arr2) # [1,2,3,4,5]
print(arr3) # [1,2,3,4]


4.How to hide a class variable from getting accessed outside the class?

class Sample:
      def __init__(self, a, b):
          self.a = a
          self.b = b
a and b should be hidden from outside of class.

Ans:-

class Sample:
      def __init__(self, a, b):
         self.__a = a # using double underscore hides class variable
         self.__b = b


1. What is Django?
ANS:- 
Django is a high-level Python-based web framework that allows rapid development with feature-rich design. It is free and open-source.

2. What are the advantages of using Django?
Ans:- 
Django is written in Python and Python is amazing, clean, easy to learn and one of the most taught programming languages. It allows rapid development as it includes a wide range of features and functionalities, such as multi-site and multi-language support, asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) support, application programming interface (APIs) and object-relational mapping (ORM). Django also has detailed documentation and tutorials

3. Explain Django architecture.
Ans:- 
Django is based on Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture. MVT is a software design pattern for developing a web application. The model helps in database management. It has a data access layer that takes care of the data. The Template is a presentation layer that takes care of the entire user interface and the View is used to convey data and render a template while also executing business logic and interacting with a model.

4.What is CRUD?
Ans:- 
CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete. These are the four basic functions that a model may be able to do. For developers, making a CRUD application is one of the very first steps. We can explain CRUD as an approach to building a Django web application. The majority of applications on the internet are CRUD applications. For example, a social media website can use CRUD operations to save your data on their database. You change your profile picture, that means to perform the update operation
